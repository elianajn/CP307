2. Max depth: 100 levels

3. O(1)

4. A loop invariant must be true during initialization, before the first time the loop is executed,
   in maintenance, before each loop, and at termination, after finishing the loop.

5.  The tree is restructured by finding either the smallest node in the right subtree of
    the node being deleted, or the largest node in the left subtree of the node being deleted.
    This means moving right once and then left until the bottom of the tree, or, if there is no
    left child to the initial right child, simply promote the right child. Would be reversed if
    doing the largest on the left subtree.

6. Because a heap will always insert the newest value from left to right at the bottom level of
   the heap. If you were to use a linked list data structure it would be significantly harder to
   find the next available location for insertion. If you are using a statically sized array you will
   know exactly which index to insert at.

7. T(n) = T(n/2) + c
        = [T(n/4) + c] + c
        = T(n/4) + 2c
        = [T(n/8) + c] + 2c
        = T(n/8) + 3
        = T(n/n**k) + kc where k=log2(n), so 2**k=n
        = T(n/n) + c*log2(n), where T(n/n) = T(1) = c
        = c + c*log2(n)
        = O(log(n))

8. Proof by induction
   Base case:
      m = 1
      1(1+1)(2(1)+1) / 6 = 1
      The base case works
   Inductive step:
      Let's say the formula is correct for m = k, so m = k+1
      Pixels(k) = k(k+1)(2k+1) / 6
      Pixels(k+1) = Pixels(k) + (k+1)**2
                  = [k(k+1)(2k+1) / 6] + (k+1)**2
                  = [(2k**3 + k**2 + k) / 6] + k**2 + 2k + 1
                  = [(2k**3 + k**2 + k) / 6] + [(2k**2 + 12k + 6) / 6]
                  = (2k**3 + 9k**2 + 13k + 6) / 6 (A)
      Pixels(k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)(2k+3) / 6
                  = [k(2k**2 + 7k + 6) + (2k**2 + 7k + 6)] / 6
                  = [2k**3 + 7k**2 + 6k + 2k**2 + 7k + 6] / 6
                  = (2k**3 + 9k**2 + 13k + 6) / 6, which is equal to (A)
      Therefor it has been proven that if the formula holds for m = k, it holds for m = k + 1.
      By the principle of mathematical induction, this formula has been proven.
